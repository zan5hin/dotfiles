This repository holds my configuration files so that I can clone them to other machines
easily.

My primary OS is OS X (10.11.x) and some of these configurations are tuned to work on that platform. From about July 2011 until January 2016 `zsh` was my shell of choice. Recently I've switched back to `bash` since my working self maintains 200+ servers using bash.

#Installation

    git clone git://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
	
#Setup
## Homebrew
On those Mac OS machines where I install Homebrew I also edit `/etc/paths` to move the `/usr/local/bin` entry to the top of the list. This ensures that Homebrew-managed programs and libraries occur prior to `/usr/bin` and system-provided programs and libraries. The resulting `/etc/paths` files looks like this:

    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/bin
    /bin
    /usr/sbin
    /sbin

The `~/.dotfiles/brew/Brewfile` acts as a bundle for Homebrew. Use `brew bundle ~/.dotfiles/brew/Brewfile` to set up brews.

## bash
For those machines where zsh isn't installed or won't easily work, create the
following symlinks:

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bash_colors ~/.bash_colors
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bash_bindkeys ~/.bash_bindkeys
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bashrc.local ~/.bashrc.local

The `.bashrc.local` file contains configurations only needed on the remote servers I manage.
Therefore this file is only linked on those remote machines.

## zsh
For zsh configuration create the following symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh ~/.zsh
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshenv ~/.zshenv
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zprofile ~/.zprofile
		
## ssh
For ssh configuration, create the following symlink:

    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ssh/config ~/.ssh/config

## Vim
For Vim configuration and use, create the following symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc.bundles ~/.vimrc.bundles
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

On remote servers where the Vim version maybe older or not under my control, eliminate the
`.vimrc.bundles` symlink. All bundles and their settings are encapsulated in this file. The `.vimrc`
file will default the color scheme and spelling dictionary settings if `.vimrc.bundles` is not
found.

To install vim-plug managed plugins run the following command from within Vim:

    :PlugInstall

To install vim-plug run the following command:

    curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

## Git
For Git configuration and global ignore files, create these symlinks:

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/git/gitignore_global ~/.gitignore_global

## Mercurial (hg)
For Mercurial configuration and global ignore files, create these symlinks:

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/hg/hgrc ~/.hgrc
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/hg/hgignore_global ~/.hgignore_global

## Gem
In order to prevent `gem install` or `gem update` from downloading RDoc and RI, symlink this file.

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/gem/gemrc ~/.gemrc

## TextMate (mate)
For TextMate 2 settings create the following symlink:

    $ ln -s ~/.dotflles/textmate/tm_properties ~/.tm_properties

## tmux (terminal multiplexer) configuration
For tmux configuration create this symlink:

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

## Sublime Text 2 (subl)
Install Package Control following the instructions here: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

For Sublime Text 2 settings, remove the `User` directory from
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`. Then add this symlink:

    $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/sublimetext/User User

Finally, to enable the command line tool, `subl`, add this symlink:

    $ ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl

## OpenConnect
An alternative to using Cisco's AnyConnect.

Requires that `openconnect` be installed via Homebrew and that TUN/TAP for OS X be installed. See http://zanshin.net/2013/08/27/setup-openconnect-for-mac-os-x-lion/
for details.

    $ ln -s ~/.dotfiles/openconnect/openconnect ~/.openconnect
